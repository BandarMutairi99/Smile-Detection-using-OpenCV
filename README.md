# Smile-Detection-using-OpenCV

# Project Description

The Smile Detection project is a real-time computer vision application that uses your webcam to detect faces and identify smiles within those faces. It is built using the OpenCV library and relies on Haar Cascade Classifiers, which are pre-trained models used to recognize specific patterns in images, such as facial features.


# Tools and Libraries Used

OpenCV â€“ For image processing and real-time video capture

Haar Cascade XML Files:

haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

haarcascade_smile.xml

# Development Environment

Code Editor: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

# Project Steps

1- Import OpenCV library

2- Load Haar Cascade classifiers

3- Start webcam video capture

4- Read frames in a loop:

Convert each frame to grayscale

Detect faces

Within each face, detect smiles

5- Draw rectangles and display text:

Blue rectangle around the face

Green rectangle around the smile

Show the text "Smiling" when a smile is detected
